# nasummary

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of nasummary is to summarize the count and percentage of missing and non-missing values for each columns of a data frame. When working with new data, it is good practice to perform an ‘exploratory data analysis’ (EDA) which refers to the initial exploration of the data to understand patterns, anomalies, and check assumptions. Often, understanding the number of missing values in a variable column then followed by a calculation of the percentage of data that the missing values account for is performed early in the EDA. This is to determine whether a variable should be used in further analyses. For example, based on your knowledge of the data and modelling assumptions, you have decided to include variables that contain missing values only if it accounts for under 25% of the total data.  The nasummary is designed to simplify this calculation by returning a data frame that summarizes the count and percentage of missing and non-missing values in an easy to read long data format.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of nasummary from [GitHub](https://github.com/): 

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-vinky-wang/projectB2")
```



## Example

We can create a data frame from an existing object, then run `na_summary()` to obtain the count and percentage of missing and non-missing values. 

We will create a matrix array object

```{r}
alpha_num <- cbind(col1= 1:3, col2 = c("A", "B", "C"))
alpha_num
```

then convert it into a data frame object

```{r}
alpha_num_df <- data.frame(alpha_num)
```

and run the `na_summary()`

```{r}
library(nasummary)
na_summary(alpha_num_df)
```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
